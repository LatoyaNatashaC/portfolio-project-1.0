            <p class="mb-4 text-muted">
              This project was part of my beginner workshop, where I gained a
              deeper understanding of advanced CSS background properties,
              enabling me to create more sophisticated backgrounds using images
              in my projects. I learned to utilize CSS transform, which allowed
              me to modify page elements effectively. I also explored CSS grids
              and began studying JavaScript. Furthermore, I acquired the skills
              to manipulate HTML classes with CSS, facilitating real-time theme
              changes for a website's styling.

              In this project, I explored advanced CSS positioning, selectors,
              and styling techniques. I learned how to implement search
              functionality within my application and investigated various
              methods for displaying the current date using JavaScript. I gained
              insights into JavaScript selectors and events, as well as how to
              create effective functions. Additionally, I was introduced to APIs
              and successfully worked with the SheCodes Forecast API, learning
              how to make API calls and interpreting the response object data. I
              practiced looping through arrays, and after much attempts, I was
              able to successfully display the live forecast for the week. Great
              project.

              In this workshop, I acquired new techniques and tools for web
              development. I delved deeper into HTML input types and select
              elements, learning how to build more sophisticated forms. I also
              explored JavaScript timing events, including setTimeout and
              setInterval, and developed various methods to format date and time
              displays. Additionally, I learned how to install external
              libraries, such as Moment.js and Moment Timezone via CDN. While
              working extensively with JavaScript presented challenges, I
              ultimately succeeded in displaying the current time and date for
              specific locations around the world. I had a lot of fun.

            <p class="mb-4 text-muted">
              In this workshop, I studied what AI is and prompt engineering. I
              practiced how to write effective prompts, how not to write a
              prompt, and how to write code to interact with different AI
              models. I worked with the SheCodes AI API, which I integrated into
              my project. For an assignment, I created a joke generator. There
              was a button to click, labeled “Tell me a joke,” after which a
              joke would appear. This was excellent practice and skill-building
              in preparation for my final project, the poem generator.

            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-muted">
              Enjoyable workshop! I studied Bootstrap in greater depth and
              learned how to import it into my project. I discovered how to host
              a multi-page website using GitHub and Netlify. I learned how to
              build a responsive navigation bar using a hamburger button menu to
              toggle between pages. For this specific project, I explored more
              utility CSS classes and responsive techniques. I also learned how
              to make my projects responsive using Bootstrap, as well as without
              it, using only vanilla CSS, HTML, and media queries. I focused
              intensely on CSS grids, responsive CSS grids, HTML tables, CSS
              filters, CSS Hero, and how to use HTML embeds. I learned how to
              embed parts of other websites into my personal website, such as
              YouTube videos and Google Maps. Additionally, I learned how to
              used the console to view my website on different devices, ensuring
              it was successfully responsive. I love spoken word, so I included
              a poem in this project. I hope you like it! I had a great time
              working on this one.

              This weather application was built using React, and I enjoyed this
              workshop. I learned the basics of React and the value of
              components, which make my code more efficient and easier to manage
              using the single responsibility principle. I learned how to import
              and include components within each other, sending data (props)
              between them. I practiced extensively with passing properties
              between components to display data. I learned how to manage
              multiple files and worked with API integrations, effectively
              reading their response. I integrated two APIs in this project: one
              for the current weather and the second for the forecast. I
              practiced looping through arrays and focused on improving
              functions. Additionally, I learned how to read React error
              messages and make the necessary adjustments to debug my code.

              This dictionary project was built using React, and it is one of my
              favorite projects. I had the opportunity to practice creating
              effective components, functions, and sending properties between
              them to improve my application. I integrated two APIs in this
              project: the SheCodes dictionary API and an images API. I
              practiced using loops and the map method to pull and display
              precise data from the APIs. I worked in depth on styling the
              responses from the APIs to create different sections for my
              dictionary and to ensure the images fit the screen. I enjoyed this
